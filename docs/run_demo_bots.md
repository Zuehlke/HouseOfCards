# Testdrive the competition runner
In order to smoke test the game-engine (competition runner) we provide two bots that will register for a game and act on
messages received from the game-engine. This is a step by step description to run the test.

Start the game-engine with the following commands:
1. Change to the directory. HouseOfCards/game-engine/game-server

2. run the command: <code>gradle run</code>. This will start the game-engine listening on TCP port 8080 on your local host.

3. Select the Intellij IDEA module "bot/bot-server".
4. Open the Run menu and select "Run...".
5. Select "Edit configuration in the pop-up window. Main class has to be "BotApplication".
6. In the field "Program arguments" enter the following arguments: teamA localhost 8081. (see screenshot)
7. Click "Run". This will start a bot that will that registers itself at the game-engine and listens on the TCP http://localhost:8081
8. Repeat steps 4-7 to start a second bot that listens on port 8082 by providing the corresponding argument.

As soon as the game-engine receives two registrations it will  start the game.
Upon receiving the YourTurn messages both bots will send a SetMessage with the smallest possible bet.

In order to start the bots with a defined list of predefined moves pass the string "tobi" or "riki" as fourth argument. E.g. teamA localhost 8081 tobi.
